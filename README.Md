### Purpose
Building off the Flaskr tutorial to learn flaskr. I created a GW2 fan wish list post. This would allow others to see the following:
 
1.Name
2.Job/Class
3.Level of said Job/Class
4.Wish for the game 
 
This semester was time crunched due to work and other classes that I never got to finish these.
Read Documentation to add BootStrap to the software

In Mac:

   1. Find the path location where you downloaded the script
   2. Using the Terminal use the cd command to navigate to the folder containing the python file. Or Drag the file into the Terminal Window.
   3. Once you are at the right folder, use python3 'file name' replacing the ' with angle brackets to execute the script.
